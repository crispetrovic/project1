    <h3> Create A Positive Affirmation </h3>
    
    <p>	Use positive affirmations to weaken negative thought patterns. <br>
        The more you reinforce positive thoughts, the more emotionally resilient <br>
        you will become. 
    </p>
    <p> Identify a resource, feeling, achievement, state of being, etc., <br>
        that you desire to experience more often. Say your positive <br>
        affirmation outloud three times a day (morning, noon, evening), <br>
        and repeat it as often as necessary until you begin to feel empowered. <br>
    </p>
	

	    <strong>Examples of positive affirmations:</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
        Example 1: <em>(if you struggle with jealousy)</em><br>
        <strong>I have</strong> everything I need, I am content with what I have, and I celebrate the blessings of others.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Example 2: <em>(if you struggle with apathy)</em><br>
        <strong>I am</strong> motivated to take responsibility for my emotions and improve my personal relationships. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Be specific.<br> 
        The more detailed you can make your affirmations, the more effective they will be. :)
